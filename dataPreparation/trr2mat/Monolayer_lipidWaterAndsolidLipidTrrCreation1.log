Lipid: DOPS
Overall simulation steps: 25000000
Gromacs simulation time step [ps]: 0.002
Saving interval [#simulationSteps]: 50
Consequently, there are 500000 frames with a dT of 0.1 ps.
--------------------------
Simulation originally was performed at :
Simulation duration [ps]: 50000
Simulation duration [ns]: 50
Simulation duration [us]: 0.05
Simulation will be read from binary as :
Starting at time 3e-08sec and ending at time 5e-08 sec
Thus, the available simulation duration is 20000 ps
--------------------------
The follwing simulation configurations will be saved
